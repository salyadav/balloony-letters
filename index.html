                    To the Sad Inhabitants of Land,<br>
        
                    <p>The sky is limitless; so is the sea. Land is this chasm in-between where the only limitlessness that can be had is through the mind.
                    This I realized the day I fled on a balloon; the best greatest step I ever took. Now, I float in the dreamy sky, drift over the azurest sea. Fish pop their mouths open and shut, seeing me. Some even fly to get at me. Perhaps they think I’m food. I’d taste bad, they should know. They’d probably die.
                    What am I? Leave it aside, a few paragraphs notwithstanding; for the limitedness of your mind will fail to grasp my joy for the infinities. There is something about “landites” that makes them utterly incapable of beholding the unbound. They grab at anything that flies, bring it down. These sinkholes. Crabs. Well, I be with them no longer.
                    I am on a quest for the fathomless. The sea would in moments strangle me, hence the sky is my comrade - forever, I hope.  I leave the confines of land behind and leap towards the infinite.    
                    </p>
                    Regards,<br>
                    Hyp O’Crite, the Slug<br><br>
                    P.S: Yes, I am a slug flying on a balloon to the sky. I know your limited mind would find the image inconceivable.

                        To the Delusional Slug in the Sky,<br>
                    
                        <p>
                            You're all balloony and baloney. There’s a reason why “landites” don’t go up there. 
                            You could die! Why? Let me lay it out for you quick:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Physical reasons: You’d fry out there! Slugs are not built for long exposure to the sun. 
                                    And not to discourage you, but what were planning to eat? Gas molecules? 
                                    Hey, we’re short of ozone as it is.
                                </p>
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Mental… Well, I’d skip that one for you. 
                                    Long times spent in isolation can have adverse psychological effects. 
                                    But you have them already.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Philosophical: Ahem. Ahem. Now I wouldn’t call this my forte, but...
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Any kind of limitlessness is in your mind. All baloney. 
                                    Always. Infinities come with flipsides. Blackholes are limitless mass but zero space. 
                                    Your precious sky is limitless space but zero (pretty much) matter. 
                                    Your brain is miniscule space and zero matter. 
                                    You gotta find that sweet spot, a balance if you must. That, dear slug, is land.

                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                            And that is where you’re fleeing from; yes, fleeing. 
                            People go looking for infinities when they find their reality too much for them, 
                            squeezing at them. Did someone squash you? Try to eat you? Yup, that’s my guess. 
                            No wonder the complex. Did the cruel randomness of life “disillusion” you? Well duh, 
                            you’re a slug – bit low down the food chain. Live with it. 
                            And don’t go about making your turn-tail escape into a noble quest. Balloony.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            I’m doing you a favour getting you back to land. 
                            Where were you going anyway? Space? The earth is round! Thank me when we meet. 
                            And store this in your two-bit-brain: balance is a tightrope walk 
                            (or slither, or whatever it is you do). But it makes life precious. 
                            Because when things are limitless, nothing has any value.  And you throw it all away.
